paperMail - Bukkit Plugin

With this plugin you can send other players items and texts with a physical mailbox.

Every player has an default mailbox which can be accessed by left clicking a mailbox sign. Also a mailbox can be created from a chest to add additional space in a players inbox.

Items can be sent either through right clicking with an item or by right clicking a mailbox sign.

Texts which are sent through a command get converted to a physical letter and get placed inside the recipients mailbox.


To Compile, Download the contents of this Repo, Make sure you have maven installed, and run
